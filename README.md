## **I. Requirements** :dart:		

### **1. Name of your system** :mage_man:	

Our group accept that the system has the name:

LibraryPal (a.k.a Companion of Librarian)

### **2. What is the purpose of the system** :raising_hand_man:	

To support librarians in managing books, our team offers a system to manage book resources, including borrowing/renting, searching for books, etc. Not only that, this system also helps readers access the latest books. Our team thinks that this system will become convenient for everyone and maybe this is not a good version but it will be as complete as possible.

### **3. Who will use the system?** :student:	

As mentioned in the purpose section, this system is aimed at the convenience of readers as well as librarians and they are also the users of this system.

### **4. List all features your system can do, arrange the features in a specific classification** :computer:	

- Admin
  - Login/Logout
  - Menu of "add a book", borrow and donate form
  - Create/Add Books
  - Delete/Remove Books
  - Managing Borrowed Books and Updating the list

## **III. ERD of LibraryPal (Database Design)**

### Reality

### First-Look
![Screenshot 2024-03-18 162121](https://github.com/dunghuynh-teaching/prj301-se1867-02/assets/135232876/fd80d780-a13b-43b1-b19c-2afee6c82330)

## **IV. System Design**
Our project aimed to help both the librarian and the reader out, especially to make all the readers feel comfortable with reading and borrowing books and to make managing books easier for the librarian. Our project was based on MVC1 in coding and our database was made in SQL Server. Many functions have been implemented but some planned ones didn't and will be pushed later if our groups have enough time and knowledge.

## **V. Conclusion and Discussion**

### 1. Pros: 
- Assist readers in finding a wide range of books.
- Ordering books on the website, providing convenience for users.
- Have a donate function which gives away books that are already read to the library.

### 2.Cons:
- The books that you are looking for might no longer be available
- Less functions
- Sometimes, the codes went error and might take some time to fix
                                
### What has been learned while developing the application
- Learned how to code a website
- Learned how to design a database
- Learned how to make a plan for building a project

### Improving my application in the future
- Add more functions
- Redecorate the application
